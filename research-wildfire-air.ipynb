    "A new theory suggests that flammable gases generated by heated vegetation, in particular the volatile organic compounds (VOC) common to certain plants, may, under certain topographic and wind conditions, accumulate in locations where, after the arrival of the ignition source, they rapidly burst into flames as explosions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, forest stands dominated by Eucalyptus (Eucalyptus globulus Labill). have been shown to be more prone to the incidence of extreme fires due to both the flammability of the species’ semi-separated shell and the emission of various volatile fuels, which can cause long-distance fire outbreaks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, other plant species (conifer trees like pine, fir, cedar and spruce) have been demonstrated to emit highly reactive volatile substances upon heating, particularly many of the volatile organic compounds (VOC), such as α-pinene. Some studies indicate that the concentration of VOCs is directly proportional to the height of the flame and inversely proportional to the time of fire ignition. In fact, due to their density being more significant than air, it is estimated that, in periods of drought, when the vegetation is more flammable, VOCs tend to accumulate at low altitudes in concentrations close to the lower flammability limit (LFL), approximately of the order of 1% (v/v). The fuel gas LFL corresponds to the minimum concentration in the air that is sufficient to promote its ignition. Thus, in the presence of favorable weather conditions and other combustion gases, many accumulated VOCs can cause a rapid and intense ignition, accelerating the propagation of the fire.

    "Volatile isoprenoids (isoprene, monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes) are the most important BVOCs emitted by undisturbed forest trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some plants may store volatile isoprenoids in liquid pools and specialized compartments (i.e. monoterpene- and sesquiterpene-emitting species: conifers, medicinal and aromatic plants, Eucalyptus spp.) or as temporary pools in non-specialized leaf structures (isoprene and light-dependent monoterpene- and sesquiterpene-emitting species). Copious amounts of these compounds can be emitted in response to wounding and high temperatures. Fires may therefore be responsible for episodes of massive BVOC emission from burning vegetation, in addition to the vegetation in close proximity to the fires. Furthermore, BVOCs are known to be flammable and to influencethe intrinsic flammability of vegetation. Fire-induced BVOC emissions may have dramatic negative impacts on the chemistry and physics of the atmosphere, because of their significant contribution to the formation of tropospheric ozone, photo-oxidants and secondary organic aerosols (SOA).
